## Problem statement

After selecting the representative features, the next step is to retrieve resumed information from these selected features. There exist various approaches to achieve this, which can be listed as follows:

* use sequence assembly techniques to get longer features and at the same time reduce the number of representative features. The concrete methods can be referred to De Bruijn Graph and overlap layout consensus assembly.
* alignment with initial sequences to get longer sequences, but this may largely increase the redundant features.
* kernel PCA and clustering can classify the selected features in order to find common characteristics such as G4.

## Kernel PCA and clustering

I display in the following the PCA the figures using spectrum kernel of k=2 (normalized). Each point is respectively projected to the first, second largest eigenvectors ($\alpha_1, \alpha_2$) of Gram matrix and first, third largest eigenvectors ($\alpha_1, \alpha_3$). Notice that deeper color, larger weight in absolute. I also display the 3 most representative k-mer in each cluster (largest in absolute).

Now spectrum kernel of k=3 (normalized).
