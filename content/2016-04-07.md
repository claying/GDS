In a first stage, I applied the ridge regression to the problem in order to get a benchmark. More precisely, the original problem can be reformulated:

$$\min_{\beta\in\mathbb R^{p}}\frac{1}{2}\left\|Y- \phi \cdot \beta\right\|_2^2+\frac{\lambda}{2} \|\beta\|_2^2$$

where the loss function has been replaced by the square loss and the regularization function has been replaced by the $\ell_2$ norm.

This problem has already been extensively studied and there are various approaches to resolve it, such as the reformulation with kernel matrix, proximal method with gradient descent. Before applying these optimization methods, we need to preprocess the data in order that it adapts more to our framework.

## Preprocessing
The principal preprocessing of our data is normalization. And there different ways to normalize $Y$ and $\phi$.

For the matrix $\phi$, inspired from the statistical approaches in information retrieval, we could consider the following means of normalization:

* normalization $\ell_2$ along the columns
* term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency ([tf-idf][1])

For the vector $Y$, we could consider the following choices:
* log
* log + centering
* log + normalization $\ell_2$
* log + centering + normalization $\ell_2$
