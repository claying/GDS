Last time, I compared the prediction results for different transformations on the matrix $\phi$. However, I didn't get any conclusion because the performance of the transformations varies as k increases. Hence, to get a more convincing comparison among these transformations, I have concatenated the feature matrices associated with k-mers of length smaller than k, i.e. $\phi$ corresponds to the matrix containing the frequencies of all the k-mers of length smaller than k. Under this configuration, we could also understand how adding longer k-mers would impact the prediction accuracy.

The difficulty is when k increases, the size of the feature matrix will become immense so that it cannot be easily stocked in the memory. In this case, we need to compress the matrix by , for example, eliminating the features which have the save binary frequency. So our next step is to compress the feature matrix.
