## Reverse complement group

Last time, I observed that there were G-quadruplex groups (GGG and CCC clusters) associated positively with the replication strength and another AT-rich group. This observation motivated us to combine the reverse complement k-mers when constructing the feature matrices. I display in the following the comparison of the CV curves before and after combination.

And the distribution of the length of the selected features, which is not largely different from that of before combination.

Some figures about kernel PCA are displayed below

If I take the sum of the mapping vector corresponding respectively to a feature and its reverse complement, I can obtain a new kernel for the combined features (feature+reverse complement). I display below some figures on this kernel PCA:

## Weighted length of k-mers and longer selected features

The number of longer selected features can be increased by reweighting the length of k-mers. More precisely, by imposing a larger $\lambda$ for shorter features, there would be more sparsity within these patterns in the linear estimate.

I display below the distribution of length of the selected features with a exponentially increasing weight (respectively from 0.1 and 0.2) with respect to the length of k-mers.
