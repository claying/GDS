## Optimization algorithm

Last time, I examined various optimization and dimension reduction approaches to improve the speed. However, I found that dimensionality reduction methods were no more useful when using active-set, i.e. active-set is sufficient since it increases incrementally the number of selected features. Thus, the only possibility to improve the speed is to find an algorithm which is more adaptable to active-set.

There may be a theoretical part to study the performance of active-set.

## CV curves for k>10

Now we can plot the cross validation curves for k>10 with concatenated feature matrices.

## distribution of selected features

I have observed that when $\lambda=1$, the prediction is almost the best and the number of selected features is around 2000. I list below the distribution of length of selected features appearing in at least 3 folds. In the section, the results are all under binary+L2 transformation.
