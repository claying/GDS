After the previous experiments on ridge regression, I have not only a first impression of feature matrices but also a benchmark for prediction performance. In this blog, I will display the cross validation results for LASSO regression. The formulation is as follows:

$$\min_{\beta\in\mathbb R^{p}}\frac{1}{2}\left\|Y- \phi \cdot \beta\right\|_2^2+\lambda \|\beta\|_1$$

where the regularization function is replaced by the norm $\ell_1$.

## Prediction performance
The configuration of the feature matrices is the same as previous, i.e. compression 1 + compression 2 (threshold=1000).

The MSE curves are displayed as follows in terms of number of selected features. I have computed MSE for k from 5 to 8, because for larger k, the computation is too slow, which leads us to continue compressing the feature matrices.
