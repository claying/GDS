## Motifs alignment

The motifs selected by lasso regression are too short to interpret. In order to obtain longer and more interpretable motifs, we propose here two tracks:

* using kernels like mismatch string kernel to increase the number of occurrences of longer kmers.
* align selected motifs to the original sequences.

The first approach is more difficult to realize since the feature matrix could be more dense and harder to compute. The second approach can be done using **bowtie**. The next step after alignment is to visualize and extract the hot regions from alignments, i.e. the regions with high coverage of the pre-selected motifs.

Ideas:

* search the points with highest coverage (i.g. bigger than 20), these points are called centres. Then for each of these centres, we search the longest subsequence in which each letter is covered by at least m (i.g. m=5) pre-selected motifs.
* plot the heatmap of coverage.

#### Heatmaps of coverage

I display below the heatmap of coverage for the most and least replicated sequences. I smoothed also these figures by using a Gaussian filter.
